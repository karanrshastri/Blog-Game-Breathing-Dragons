6 A.M. "Buzzzzzz" the alarm goes off. It's a cold December Sunday morning. By cold I mean really, really cold. -25 degrees cold. Growing up in Warsaw, the cold didn't bother me that much. As a matter of fact, I liked winters. Nay, I loved winters. Building snowmen, hot chocolate every morining and good 'ol Polish bone soup everday (Bone soup sounds weird, but trust me, it's the best damn soup I've had), it doesn't get any better than this.</br>
<br>
"Karan! Wake up!" I totally forgot that my dad and I were supposed to go to this shady part of the city, "The Stadium". The stadium was one of my favorite places to go on a weekend in Warsaw, in fact it was my favorite place to go on any given day, period. The stadium was this wonderland which was primarily known for selling pirated video games from makeshift stalls. Not only video games, they had all kinds of bootleg music CDs, knock off jackets and clothing. Stalls displayed with all the latest Playstation 1 games and memory cards were the ones that always caught my eye. These games were even sometimes based on the local language, there was no supervision on copyright infringement. This was the only place in Warsaw where one could get his hands on the new crash bandicoot or Rayman game, there was no alternate place to buy these games in Warsaw in the early 2000s. </br>
<br>
The national stadium now is an international football stadium, hosted the 2012 Euro Cup and several concerts and international events, but the memory of those times remains. The best game I've played, was one which I picked up from the stadium back in the days, it had this intriguing mystical but cartoony purple dragon on its cover and the name "Spyro 3:Year of the Dragon" written on it. My most profound childhood memories include playing this game. </br>
<br>
Spyro 3:Year of the Dragon, followed the story of this purple colored dragon named, Spyro. It was developed by Insomniac Games and was the third instalment to the Spyro franchise. I had not played the previous two games, and at the time never realized that the game was a sequel to the other two, it was a gem in iteslf. The objective of the game was to collect different eggs around different worlds, collecting gems and treasures along the way. What made this game so special at the time was it's sublime 3D graphics and use of bright colors coupled with an amazing story and characters. Playing Spyro for me, was peaceful and calming. The game was so good, that even my father joined in and played the game, from time to time. </br>
<br>
I think Spyro has and always will have a special place in my heart, because this was one of those games which made me appreciate video games for their storytelling and narrative. And also motivated me to create or build something like Spyro: Year of the Dragon.
